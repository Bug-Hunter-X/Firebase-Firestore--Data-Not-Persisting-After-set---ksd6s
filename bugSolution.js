The problem was resolved by creating a composite index in the Firestore rules.  I accessed the Firestore console, navigated to the 'Indexes' tab for my collection, and added a new index. This index included the fields used in the query. The updated code remains functionally the same, but now correctly interacts with the newly created index.  No code changes were needed in the application code itself; the index creation in Firestore was the solution.
